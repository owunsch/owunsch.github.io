  description: >-
    *A Delicate Matter: Art, Fragility, and Consumption in Eighteenth-Century France* examines how fragile media such as pastels, terracottas, and even oil paintings prone to cracking, became prized commodities in a burgeoning eighteenth-century art market. I argue that commercial modernity’s embrace of ephemerality created the conditions for artists to experiment with unstable materials and techniques as never before. In the process, artists turned fragility from a liability into a resource, transforming the instability of consumer goods into a vehicle for evanescent forms of subjective expression. By investing fragility itself with expressive power, they sought to distinguish the flimsiness of disposable commodities from the exalted delicacy of transcendent art.
