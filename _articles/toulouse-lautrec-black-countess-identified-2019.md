abstract: "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s 1881 painting *The Black Countess* portrays a striking Black woman speeding along the coast of Nice, but for more than a century her identity remained unknown. Archival research presented here reveals her to be Anne Justine Angèle Delva de Dalmarie, a Haitian-born aristocrat who became a minor celebrity in the French press. Recovering her name clarifies the painting’s social context while exposing a deeper paradox: in the belle époque, Black visibility could generate notoriety without recognition, leaving a woman's individuality obscured behind a racialized epithet."
