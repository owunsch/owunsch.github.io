abstract: "This essay reinterprets François Boucher’s portrait of Madame de Pompadour by asking what it meant, in mid-eighteenth-century France, to paint oneself pink. Situating the work within the rise of Atlantic slavery and the global cosmetics trade, it argues that complexion was not merely enhanced by artifice but materially and conceptually produced through it. By placing the portrait in dialogue with a contemporary harem scene also commissioned by Pompadour, the study shows how whiteness emerged as a staged and commercially mediated sign of identity at the intersection of gender, class mobility, and empire."
